# custom-google-signin-auth

A Node.js application for Google sign-in can be used to authenticate users and get their data from Google. The following is a general outline of how the process might work:

A user clicks on a "Sign in with Google" button on your application's frontend.

The frontend sends a request to the Node.js server to initiate the Google sign-in process.

The Node.js server redirects the user to Google's authentication page, where the user can sign in with their Google account.

After the user signs in, Google redirects the user back to the Node.js server with an authorization code.

The Node.js server uses the authorization code to request an access token from Google.

The Node.js server uses the access token to make API requests to Google's servers to retrieve the user's data.

The Node.js server sends the user's data back to the frontend, which can then use it to personalize the user's experience.
